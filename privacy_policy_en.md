# Privacy Policy

This document describes how data is handled in this extension. User privacy and security are a priority, so only the necessary information is collected to enhance the user experience.

## Data Collection and Usage

- The extension **does not collect, store, or share personal data**.
- Only data necessary for the extension's functionality, such as user settings and preferences, is used.
- No data is sent to third parties, except for services activated within the extension.

## External Services

Some features of the extension may rely on third-party services, but **only if the user manually enables them**:

- **[SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)**: Used to skip sponsored segments in YouTube videos. Information about the currently playing video is sent to obtain the timestamps of segments to skip.
- **[Return YouTube Dislike](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/)**: Restores the dislike functionality on YouTube videos. The API is queried to retrieve the number of dislikes.

These services have their own privacy policies, and it is recommended to review them before enabling them.

## Data Storage

- All user settings and preferences are stored **locally** in the browser.
- No telemetry or tracking is performed.

## Security

- No passwords, cookies, or sensitive information are collected.
- The extension operates with the minimum permissions necessary for its functionality.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

Any changes to the privacy policy will be communicated through this repository. It is recommended to review this document periodically.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about privacy in this extension, you can open an **issue** in this repository or contact the developer.
